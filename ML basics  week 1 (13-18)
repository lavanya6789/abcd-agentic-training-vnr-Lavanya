13.1. Bias and Variance
     -The video uses a dartboard analogy to explain Bias and Variance:
     -Bias is the distance between the average of your predictions and the correct value (the bullseye).
     -High Bias means the model is consistently missing the target (underfitting the data).
     -Low Bias means the average of the predictions is close to the target.
     -Variance is the spread of your predictions (how scattered they are from one another).
     -High Variance means the predictions are scattered widely (overfitting the data).
     -low Variance means the predictions are tightly clustered.
     -The Bias-Variance Tradeoff explains that reducing one often increases the other. The goal is to find a balance that minimizes the total error.

13.2. Hypothesis Testing and P-Value
The concept of statistical significance is introduced through Hypothesis Testing:

A Null Hypothesis (Ha) is the default position, stating there is no effect (e.g., rainfall has no effect on raincoat demand).

An Alternate Hypothesis (Ha) is what you are trying to prove (e.g., rainfall increases raincoat demand).

The P-Value is a probability that helps decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. It is the probability of observing the data you have, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

If the P-Value is less than 0.05 (the common significance level), you reject the null hypothesis, concluding the feature or relationship is statistically significant.

13.3. Confusion Matrix
The Confusion Matrix is a performance measurement tool for classification problems [13:09]. It compares the model's predictions to the actual results:
-True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive.
-True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative.
-False Positive (FP) : Incorrectly predicted positive (e.g., telling a healthy person they have a disease).
-False Negative (FN) : Incorrectly predicted negative (e.g., telling a sick person they are healthy).

13.4. Normalization (Min-Max Scaling)
Normalization is a data preprocessing technique to standardize or scale features.
Min-Max Scaling is shown, which transforms data to fit within a specific range, typically [0, 1].

13.5. Correlation and Feature Selection
Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1.

Positive Correlation (~+1): Both variables increase togethe.
Negative Correlation (~-1): As one variable increases, the other decreases.

14. Coefficient and Intercept
In the context of Linear Regression, the line equation is defined as Y=mX+C:

The Coefficient (m) represents the slope of the line, indicating the change in the output (Y) for every unit change in the input (X) [39:35]. In regression, the coefficient quantifies the strength and direction of a feature's impact on the prediction.

The Intercept (C) is the point where the line crosses the Y-axis, representing the predicted value of Y when all input features (X) are zero.

15. Linear Regression - Linear, Multi Linear, Learning Rate, Loss function
This video provides a comprehensive tutorial on the Linear Regression algorithm, a technique used for predictive modeling.

Types of Linear Regression: It introduces both Simple Linear Regression (one independent variable) and Multi-Linear Regression (multiple independent variables).

Model Equation: The core equation Y = mX + c is explained, where m is the slope and c is the intercept.

Loss Function and Optimization: The concept of the Loss Function (or cost function) is discussed, which quantifies the error of the model's predictions. The video explains how Gradient Descent uses the Learning Rate (Alpha) to iteratively minimize this loss function and find the optimal values for the slope and intercept.

16. Logistic Regression
This tutorial focuses on Logistic Regression, which is a classification algorithm used to predict a discrete outcome (e.g., 0 or 1).
The Sigmoid Function: The video details the Sigmoid Function (or logistic function). This function takes the output of a linear equation and transforms it into a probability value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for classification problems.
Classification: It explains how Logistic Regression is used for Binary Classification (e.g., classifying outcomes into two classes) and can be extended to Multi-Class Classification.
Cost Function: The video covers the specific cost function used for Logistic Regression, known as Cross-Entropy or Log Loss.

17. All about Decision Tree
Tree Terminology: It defines key components of the tree structure:
Root Node: The starting node of the tree.
Internal Nodes (Decision Nodes): Nodes that have branches to other nodes.
Leaf Nodes (Terminal Nodes): Nodes that represent the final classification or prediction.
Splitting Criteria: The tutorial explains how the tree decides which feature to split on at each node using metrics like Gini Impurity and Information Gain. The goal is to maximize the purity of the resulting subsets.

18. Random Forest, Grid Search and Cross Validation
Cross-Validation (CV):
It covers methods like the Holdout Method (simple train/test split), K-Fold Cross-Validation (splitting data into K subsets), and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation.
Hyperparameters and Grid Search CV:
It defines Hyperparameters as algorithm-specific inputs (like maximum depth in a decision tree).
Grid Search CV is presented as an automated method to find the best combination of hyperparameters by testing every possible combination within a defined range.

Random Forest:The Random Forest algorithm is explained as an Ensemble Technique that combines the output of multiple Decision Trees (bagging) to make a final prediction.
It details how Random Forest makes its final prediction: using a majority vote for classification problems or an average for regression problems.
